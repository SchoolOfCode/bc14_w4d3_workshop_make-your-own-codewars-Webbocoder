ðŸ‘‰ Write your kata here!

Oh no, an asteroid collided with the rainbow and now all its colours are jumbled up!
Quick, you've got to put them back in the right order: "red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet"!

The output case needs to match the input case.
Sometimes, colours in the input array will be superfluous and will need to be omitted.
Sometimes, colours in the input array will be omitted; if this is the case, should should be no gap in the output array.

For example:
The Input: ["rEd", "yelLow", "greeN", "blue", "purPle", "iNdigo", "voileT"]
Should return:
["rEd", "yelLow", "greeN", "blue", "iNdigo", "voileT"]
